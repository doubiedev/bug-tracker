# Bug Tracker

This project is a MERN stack app aiming to be a bug tracker similar to something like Jira. It contains projects, issues (tickets), comments, as well as users with different authorisation levels.

It is incomplete as of the moment. The backend and API is mostly built out, the frontend is not.

Technologies include:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Nodejs
- Vite
- Mongoose
- Bcrypt
- Bootstrap & React-bootstrap
- Others can be seen in the package.json's
